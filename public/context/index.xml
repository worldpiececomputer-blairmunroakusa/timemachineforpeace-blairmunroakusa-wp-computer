      <description>This library is incomplete. If I had the money, this would be about 300% larger. I like physical copies of things, so all my electronic stuff would be here also.
Of the works in my library, I have seriously studied about 25% of these pieces. 45% I have read once. 25% I have reviewed and use as inspiration for my work. 5% I have not read, but the book serves as a future pointer, or a placeholder for future reading/work.</description>
