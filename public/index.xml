Peace consulting work for storage landlord.
Excercise for health and processing, mountain: high intensity intervals, active rest with pushups/situps. Total pushups, 170; total situps, 300ish; pullup set stretch sandwich warmdown, total pullups, 70.
Excercise process thoughts (incomplete conversation review), re kickstarter:  Use website population as writing blocks for campaign. (Patrick) Not “A” movement. My contrarian perspective: Every Human has a unique contrarian perspective, which via clever technologies and translation techniques, may all be aligned as one.</description>

Long day, but solved a bunch of head problems and made enough money to afford hike/exercise gas for summer.
Finished day with non-verbal broadcast communication piece.
Nonverbal communication broadcast, mindmapping/reflection piece, 06/14/21.
 I am exhausted though.
Three 10hr sleeps scheduled before next market weekend. I will have ~ 32 hours (after deducting excercise/hygeine time) for kickstarter production.

      <description>Daily market recap:
Too tired (and too busy setting up proper blog at moment) to write much. Attached picture: conversation chain of the day. Each link represents a (highly) significant conversation about peace. Community peace art. And after reflecting on the wisdom I gleaned from all the wise people who spoke with me, a thought from me to you: Without courage, you have nothing. I think you need to devote your life to something.</description>

      <description>Fridays at the market are slow, great for taking things methodically, and really soaking it all in. The configuration today was slightly different than last Sunday. I repeated the front table for greeting ease, repeated the interior table, this time with conceptual text pieces that I am annotating throughout the day. I also reintroduced the briefcase cluster computer along the back, and this time included a library of curious influences for casual perusing.</description>

      <description>This is a site to chronicle and coordinate the Time Machine For Peace social invention project.
Please visit github to view site change history.
My target frequency is to update this site daily.
This is a diagram expressing topological gestalt.
 A NOTE ON PERSONAL STYLE:
I operate on a different frequency. I am the producer right now. Until that changes for this project, expect constant changes everywhere, but consistently inconsistently.</description>

      <description>[1330.061621]
My frustration is that to be at peace in my world, I have a specific vision in my head I need to realize. Thus I have something I need to say to everybody.
Our planet consists of some 10 billion irreducibly unique worlds. I need to translate this vision into a message, in a way that reaches each world, so that we can coordinate a Universal Peace Process that methodically and systematically (computationally) links our worlds together in iteratively better ways.</description>

      <description>I dedicate the Time Machine For Peace social invention project to the following people:  Victims of war in all forms, both external and internal American veterans who took the oath to support and defend the values of the US Constitution &amp;hellip;especially those who paid the ultimate price &amp;hellip;especially those who embrace a fierce hatred for war People struggling with mental illness Atypical people struggling to be themselves in a judgemental xenophobic world People struggling to find their voice, because they have something they desperately need to say Free thinkers who face oppression The interested&amp;ndash;yet impartial&amp;ndash;observers The overwatch My family All the people who have shared their wisdom and experience with me, either directly or indirectly, living or dead  &amp;hellip; if you have had a genuine or disingenuine conversation with me, no matter how short, you have contributed to this project</description>
