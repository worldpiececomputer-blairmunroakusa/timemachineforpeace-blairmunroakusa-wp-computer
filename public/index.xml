      <description>Market weekend was super fulfilling, but intense and a lot to process. I am going to have a fuckoff day by working for my buddies Cedar and Brian who own 49th State Motor Tours as an ATV touring guide. &amp;ndash;Make some gas cash and process time. If you are from out of town, go on a tour with them! It will rock your world.
The objective of today is to review conversations from the weekend in my head while riding a fourwheeler ~50 miles in Knik Valley.</description>

      <description>Daily market recap:
Too tired (and too busy setting up proper blog at moment) to write much. Attached picture: conversation chain of the day. Each link represents a (highly) significant conversation about peace. Community peace art. And after reflecting on the wisdom I gleaned from all the wise people who spoke with me, a thought from me to you: Without courage, you have nothing. I think you need to devote your life to something.</description>

      <description>Fridays at the market are slow, great for taking things methodically, and really soaking it all in. The configuration today was slightly different than last Sunday. I repeated the front table for greeting ease, repeated the interior table, this time with conceptual text pieces that I am annotating throughout the day. I also reintroduced the briefcase cluster computer along the back, and this time included a library of curious influences for casual perusing.</description>

A NOTE ON PERSONAL STYLE:
I am the producer right now. Until that changes for this project, expect constant changes everywhere, but consistently inconsistently. I am fickle; besides my unpredictability, I am unpredictable. This is because I am constantly experimenting with ideas, I move extremely quickly, and because my time is so precious to me that I refuse to afford time to explain my every move unless that explanation justifies the time spent explaining.</description>
