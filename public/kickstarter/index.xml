      <description>00 - Kickstarter Pretext
 piece reflections / review / self-comments
(061721) This feels **way** too dramatic..lots of outside voice shouting My mood while writing was definitely leaning toward the red (emotional) side {TODO . highlight these dramatic portions in red} {TODO . dedramatize / take out the shouting} ! The dump was good though...got me thinking about FAQ ! Also got me thinking about treating tmfp.wp.computer as exhibit ! (traverse via section menu, left to right) Taking about the bit about my dad.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Blair. I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce myself:
I&amp;rsquo;m approaching the Kickstarter community because I am looking for help getting on my feet, and I want to establish a lasting relationship within the communities that I am most interested in working with. To prepare for this kickstarter, I set up a market research and development booth for the summer at my local weekend market up here in Anchorage, Alaska, where I call home.</description>

      <description>This is a planet-benefit project.
 Current pretext note, 062321:
Instead of attempting to describe this big idea in a pretty package, this Kickstarter and the paper trail that represents my efforts, will serve as an imperfect example of universal peace. Instead of attempting to just tell you, I will do my best to show you. This campaign will probably change dramatically over the course of the next two months. Hopefully after meeting the funding goal, by a year&amp;rsquo;s end following the conclusion of this campaign, I will have a pretty packaged current edition of the big idea to share.</description>

      <title>07/23/21 - Project description video practice and process</title>

      <description>These are videos of me practicing and figuring out how to make a Kickstarter project description video and structure content in a way that is true to my style, etc. I absolutely hate watching myself, but it must be done. I don&amp;rsquo;t have time right now to annotate all the self-criticisms and changes made since then, so I won&amp;rsquo;t. I recommend saving yourself time by watching on 2x speed.
To simplify things, the card computer is no longer a reward for supporting the kickstarter.</description>
