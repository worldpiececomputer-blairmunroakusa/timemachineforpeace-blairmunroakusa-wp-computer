      <description>00 - Kickstarter Pretext
 piece reflections / review / self-comments
(061721) This feels **way** too dramatic..lots of outside voice shouting My mood while writing was definitely leaning toward the red (emotional) side {TODO . highlight these dramatic portions in red} {TODO . dedramatize / take out the shouting} ! The dump was good though...got me thinking about FAQ ! Also got me thinking about treating tmfp.wp.computer as exhibit ! (traverse via section menu, left to right) Taking about the bit about my dad.</description>

      <description>This is a planet-benefit project.
 Current pretext note, 062321:
Instead of attempting to describe this big idea in a pretty package, this Kickstarter, and the paper trail that represents my efforts, will serve as an imperfect example of universal peace. Instead of attempting to tell you, I will do my best to show you. This campaign will probably change dramatically over the course of the next two months. Hopefully after meeting the funding goal, by a year&amp;rsquo;s end following the conclusion of this campaign, I will have a pretty packaged current edition of the big idea to share.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Blair. I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce myself:
I&amp;rsquo;m approaching the Kickstarter community because I am looking for help getting on my feet, and I want to establish a lasting relationship within the communities that I am most interested in working with. To prepare for this kickstarter, I set up a market research and platform development booth for the summer at my local weekend market up here in Anchorage, Alaska, where I call home.</description>
