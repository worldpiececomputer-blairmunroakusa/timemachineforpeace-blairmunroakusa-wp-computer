      <description>COMMUNICATION STYLE DISCLAIMER: This messy kickstarter is a deliberate strategy meant to provide a transparent way of sharing my process/world. The purpose of this communication strategy is to determine the best way of going about doing things, by making my process/world completely accessible to people who may be able to help. Everything here is highly experimental. I am using this website as the writing-base for this kickstarter, so that potential backers can use github to see how the presentation has evolved over the course of the campaign, as I glom onto others willing to help refine this peace-crude.</description>
