      <description>00 - Kickstarter Pretext
 piece reflections / review / self-comments
(061721) This feels **way** too dramatic..lots of outside voice shouting My mood while writing was definitely leaning toward the red (emotional) side {TODO . highlight these dramatic portions in red} {TODO . dedramatize / take out the shouting} ! The dump was good though...got me thinking about FAQ ! Also got me thinking about treating tmfp.wp.computer as exhibit ! (traverse via section menu, left to right) Taking about the bit about my dad.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m approaching the Kickstarter community because I am looking for help getting on my feet, and I want to establish a lasting relationship within the communities that I am most interested in working with. To prepare for this kickstarter, I set up a market research and platform development booth for the summer at my local weekend market up here in Anchorage, Alaska, where I call home.</description>
