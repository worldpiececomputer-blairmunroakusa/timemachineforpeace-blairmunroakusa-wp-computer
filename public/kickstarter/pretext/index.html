    <p style="font-size:8px;">COMMUNICATION STYLE DISCLAIMER: This messy kickstarter is a deliberate strategy meant to provide a transparent way of sharing my process/world. The purpose of this communication strategy is to determine the best way of going about doing things, by making my process/world completely accessible to people who may be able to help. Everything here is highly experimental. I am using this website as the writing-base for this kickstarter, so that potential backers can use github to see how the presentation has evolved over the course of the campaign, as I glom onto others willing to help refine this peace-crude.<p>
<p>This might be hard to follow, because my mind operates in a highly nonlinear way, and at a very different frequency than mainstream anything is used to. Honestly, I rely on in-person conversation to stay focused. I rely on the linearity of other people&rsquo;s thought process to organize my thoughts in real time. If I just have myself in my head, I sprawl and people call me delusional and manic. It feels horrible when people call me this, so I have been working in private for many years.</p>
<p>This is where I will transparently work on the Kickstarter campaign to fund our efforts (right now funding to afford salary for me and the mouse in my pocket, for at least a year of dedicated work).</p>
<p>THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT IS GETTING THIS MASSIVE SPRAWLING IDEA OUT OF MY HEAD. MY WORLD PEACE DEPENDS ON THIS. IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS TO ME AND I WILL NOT LET ANYTHING OR ANYBODY INTERFERE WITH THIS. IF ONE ATTEMPT DOES NOT WORK, I TRY SOMETHING ELSE. I WILL KEEP TRYING UNTIL I SUCCEED OR PERMANENTLY FAIL. Please! I know this is scattered, but I need to be myself. Thank you for your patience while I figure this out as I go.</p>
<p>I am selling a process, not a product. This content and presentation is all very rough, because that is the idea. I do not have it figured out, but I am attempting to define a technological/social process (ai, actual intelligence, a peace process) that will hopefully allow us to figure things out as we go, individually, by one-another&rsquo;s sides, as a community, not a mob-mind.</p>
<p>For me peace is an individual process. It is not a product&ndash;not a result. We must connect our individual peace processes together in iteratively better ways. I call this <strong>Universal Peace</strong>.</p>
<p>For me the idea is to be honest about not having it figured out. To stop faking it. To just be one&rsquo;s self, and let the surrounding world sort things out as it may. I think we all need to adopt this approach if we are to solve our existential problems.</p>
<p>So for my personal situation, I adocate for strict transparency. You need to know who I am, and why. I will not censor my content, but I will aspire to be more and more graceful and tactful in my word choice and delivery. My word choice is deliberate, and if you percieve (&hellip;mike drop)</p>
<p>Becuase I think people are all that really matter, this idea and project is strictly incomplete without knowing the context of my inner experience and my outer experience.</p>
<p>I am technically a person who suffers from severe mental illness. To make sense of me in terms of those labels, think of a combination of ADHD brain, the schizophrenic spectrum (schizoaffective bipolar), and the autistic spectrum (I related strongly to self-reports of nonverbal autistics). My personality is fragmented into many bodies. Depending on how physically unhealthy I am, those personalities fall into the categories of the personality disorder clusters.</p>
<p>Officially, I am bipolar type 1, with persistent delusions. But my experience with the professional mental health system led me to conclude that there is actually nothing wrong with me. I am just extremely atypical and have a very difficult time fitting in, and I have a very difficult time translating my inner world into something linear that normal people understand without accusing me of being &lsquo;delusional&rsquo; and &lsquo;incomprehensible&rsquo; and &lsquo;sick brain&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the catch. I realized the other day (5 weeks ago when I quit my fancy-pants job to pursue this effort full time, to kick myself into the deep end) that the only reason for my suffering and inner war is that I buy into their narratives, and that at times I have been a very rude and nasty and disrespectful person in the past. This is mainly because I am frustrated and in constant emotional pain, and I thought the only way to deal with that is to numb it with dependencies, escape, or to force it onto others, so that they can share the burden. This doesn&rsquo;t work so well.</p>
<p>Now I realize that pain management is basically life management, we all hold an enormous amount of some kind of lumbering pain, and to manage life effectively a computational approach is essential.</p>
<p>I need help. Admitting I have a problem is the necessary first step.</p>
<p>Please help me get on my feet. Asking for help is the next step.</p>
<p>The first step is to start small and get my world right. This means I need the financial ability to be a creative independent on my own terms. I need freedom to be myself, so that I can get the big idea out of my head without risk of distortion / perversion / manipulation by disgenuine outside influence.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I have spent tens of thousands of hours working on this project at a direct capacity. This time is all toward building a concept map, or a blueprint, in my head for general communication purposes (think in terms of a mental letter-board). If I am honest with myself, besides my struggles with inner war, I have spent my entire life working on this project. Over the years have spent well over $100,000 of my own money on various attempts to develop this project, and on my education and self-grooming.</p>
<p>Of my many skills, I am a method actor. Of the time spend building my concept map, I have spent thousands of hours in private practicing and adjusting and evolving various deliveries of the individual concepts. All the mirror time, practicing expressions, experimenting with intonation, word-choice, versionization, attitude variation, all that. When you speak to me in person, I am referring to this concept map and all the variations I have practiced in real time, to match your needs for linearity, or nonlinearity, depending on your style.</p>
<p>As practice evolved into more refined process, I discovered my style. It is natural to me now. My style is genuine, yet adaptive. I can form a geniune connection with anybody.</p>
<p>My ability to have normal conversation and be myself depends on my mental concept map. Without my map, I am completely ineffective at communicating anything.</p>
