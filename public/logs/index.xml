      <description>New bell installed. Ring for choose-your-own-adventure.
Brian / Maya, if you are reading this, you should stop by the booth for a picture with your UPC support tokens and I. It would help with the Kickstarter I am angling toward.

Peace consulting work for storage landlord.
Excercise for health and processing, mountain: high intensity intervals, active rest with pushups/situps. Total pushups, 170; total situps, 300ish; pullup set stretch sandwich warmdown, total pullups, 70.
Excercise process thoughts (incomplete conversation review), re kickstarter:  Use website population as writing blocks for campaign. (Patrick) Not “A” movement. My contrarian perspective: Every Human has a unique contrarian perspective, which via clever technologies and translation techniques, may all be aligned as one.</description>

Long day, but solved a bunch of head problems and made enough money to afford hike/exercise gas for summer.
Finished day with non-verbal broadcast communication piece.
Nonverbal communication broadcast, mindmapping/reflection piece, 06/14/21.
 I am exhausted though.
Three 10hr sleeps scheduled before next market weekend. I will have ~ 32 hours (after deducting excercise/hygeine time) for kickstarter production.
