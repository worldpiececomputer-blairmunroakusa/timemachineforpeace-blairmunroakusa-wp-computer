      <description>Daily market recap:
Too tired (and too busy setting up proper blog at moment) to write much. Attached picture: conversation chain of the day. Each link represents a (highly) significant conversation about peace. Community peace art. And after reflecting on the wisdom I gleaned from all the wise people who spoke with me, a thought from me to you: Without courage, you have nothing. I think you need to devote your life to something.</description>

      <description>Fridays at the market are slow, great for taking things methodically, and really soaking it all in. The configuration today was slightly different than last Sunday. I repeated the front table for greeting ease, repeated the interior table, this time with conceptual text pieces that I am annotating throughout the day. I also reintroduced the briefcase cluster computer along the back, and this time included a library of curious influences for casual perusing.</description>
