Good sleep, 10hr. Slow start to day, social hygeine took more time than expected, but had golden conversation that contributes well to kickstarter idea to more effectively reach target audience.
Doing chores.
Reviewing conversation chain from last two market weekends, using review to consolidate learning for purpose of creating kickstarter campaign that is consistent with long term objectives.
Conversation chain under review. Each segment is a highly significant interaction I had with someone who expressed genuine interest.</description>

Long day, but solved a bunch of head problems and made enough money to afford hike/exercise gas for summer.
Finished day with non-verbal broadcast communication piece.
Nonverbal communication broadcast, mindmapping/reflection piece, 06/14/21.
 I am exhausted though.
Three 10hr sleeps scheduled before next market weekend. I will have ~ 32 hours (after deducting excercise/hygeine time) for kickstarter production.

Market weekend was super fulfilling, but intense and a lot to process.</description>

      <description>Daily market recap:
Too tired (and too busy setting up proper blog at moment) to write much. Attached picture: conversation chain of the day. Each link represents a (highly) significant conversation about peace. Community peace art. And after reflecting on the wisdom I gleaned from all the wise people who spoke with me, a thought from me to you: Without courage, you have nothing. I think you need to devote your life to something.</description>

      <description>Fridays at the market are slow, great for taking things methodically, and really soaking it all in. The configuration today was slightly different than last Sunday. I repeated the front table for greeting ease, repeated the interior table, this time with conceptual text pieces that I am annotating throughout the day. I also reintroduced the briefcase cluster computer along the back, and this time included a library of curious influences for casual perusing.</description>
