<p>Peace consulting work for storage landlord.</p>
<p>Excercise for health and processing, mountain: high intensity intervals, active rest with pushups/situps. Total pushups, 170; total situps, 300ish; pullup set stretch sandwich warmdown, total pullups, 70.</p>
<font size=1>
Excercise process thoughts (incomplete conversation review), re kickstarter:
<ul>
<li>Use website population as writing blocks for campaign.</li>
<li>(Patrick) Not “A” movement.</li>
<li>My contrarian perspective: Every Human has a unique contrarian perspective, which via clever technologies and translation techniques, may all be aligned as one.</li>
<li>Jaron Lanier, we do not have an AI problem … AI just ramps up the rate of the typical social distortion and perversion process. It is not that we have bad AI algorithms, it is that we have bad ai (actual intelligence) algorithms.</li>
<li>Thesis: social awareness via conversation (individual mindfulness) is all we need to disrupt the AI / Human perversion and distortion cycle. It must be relentless though. It must become a part of our natural communication protocols, our ai algorithms.</li>
<li>Need to explain how project development works. It is all about integrating people&rsquo;s perspectives and wisdom, contextualized in terms of own experience. This project is the product of hundreds, maybe thousands?, of deeply profound conversations I&rsquo;ve had and perspectives I&rsquo;ve assimilated from people from all walks of life.</li>
<li>Is mom and dad right? Is my brain broken? Is my dream just sickness? As much as I want to say I don&rsquo;t care what they think, I do. (J Cole, Let Go My Hand) I would rather die than do anything other than commit myself wholly to this project.</li>
<li>Brian and Maya are so awesome.</li>
<li>I need to post my library stat.</li>
<li>Should I show my face more? I really hold back on neon gray.</li>
<li>I need to text Jimmy.</li>
<li>Laboratories for Peace (World Peace Labs) Individuals are key.</li>
<li>Yes, Patrick, I am taking it slowly. I have been for a long time. I just take giant steps.</li>
<li>It is official, the cat is out of the bag. This is on the internet and the media mill will eventually catch hold. I have forced a choice on people: Do we commit to the great peacespace race? Or do we just let it twist out of control into a bungle of perversion and distortion.</li>
<li>Partrick, the No Mind philosophy will need to be integrated into world piece computers and The Universal Peace Computer operating systems by definition.</li>
<li>Next weekend will probably need to be kickstarter work weekend at booth. Rear facing, all content up at front, dedication sign to my people, mirror to watch back, UPS for computer, rock computer indicator and protocol for people who wish to initiate a conversation with me about universal peace. This will be a test to see if extra wide berth of space works better for giving people a chance to absorb at their own pace, instead of me awkwardly sitting there while they read my signage.</li>
<li>NEED TO ANNOTATE INTRODUCTION SIGN TOMORROW. + ADD tmfp.wp.computer QR?
</font></li>
</ul>
<p>(2100.06152021)</p>
<p>Site work. Writing.</p>
<p>Added slogan and process statment.</p>
<p>About section revision.</p>
<p>Dedication section creation.</p>
<p>CTA, TM and switch.</p>
<p>Log update.
Probably just getting 8 hr sleep tonight.. not 10. Tired. Sleep time.</p>

<p>Good sleep, 10hr. Slow start to day, social hygeine took more time than expected, but had golden conversation that contributes well to kickstarter idea to more effectively reach target audience.</p>
<p>Doing chores.</p>
<p>Preparing to disconnect and review conversation chain from last two market weekends, using review to consolidate learning for purpose of creating kickstarter campaign that is consistent with long term objectives.</p>

<p class="caption"> Conversation chain under review. Each segment is a highly significant interaction I had with someone who expressed genuine interest. Each highly significant conversation represents a token of value (personal learning) that is a product of the market booth R&D effort. Each link color was chosen by the person (people) I spoke with at the end of the conversation to add the the chain. This is a community art project, that is meant to secretly teach people how pointers work, and get people thinking about computer memory in digital non-electronic terms, using a discrete color system, where every entry represents a unit of time, with a corresponding value. 06/15/21.</p>
