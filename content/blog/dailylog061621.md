Quick color review for conversation chain.

_Need to start using online space in place of physical notebooks, at least for main working notes._

_(1130)_

_need to create market recaps later_

Jumping back on Kickstarter to reaquaint with campaign process.

_(1200)_

_Adding kickstarter page to tmfp now._

struggling with menu bits...need to activate secondary menu for kickstarter page

first, fleeting action thought...move about topology picture to main page...actually, just moving to top of about page...bumping into html issue.

_(1230)_

_In weeds, aborting separate menu prospect for Kickstarter section . need to understand HUGO innards better. No time now . maybe after solving money problem, or after boradcasting help request . back to kickstarter writing / scheming_

updating css...fonts too large. Nevermind, css file too busy..distracting..back to writing.

I do need to figure out how to just add an arbitrary html page to the site and then link to that. I think I need that stat, especially for organizational purposes.

Okay, solved it. Just need to add .md file to content, structure everythign in the content section.

Hack-around for secondary kickstarter menu: list of links at top of Kickstarter section. Implementign now.

Focusing on just dumping it all out. 00 - Kickstarter Pretext

Need to start committing more frequently so that the writing dumps changes have higher time resolution.

_(1530)_

_good writing dump to 00 - Kickstarter Pretext...need to dump visual aids now_

Mountain break, for time, 160 pushups, 280 situps, 65 pullups.

On vice struggles, complete crash and burn.

Trying to convert resume into personal story...probably too much to tackle right now. Losing focus, need to get visual aids up and meaningful writing pieces from last weekend's market session.

(2200.061621)

Reflected on 00 - Kickstarter Pretext...good dump, super red, need to revise.

outlined FAQ section...to start conversation.
