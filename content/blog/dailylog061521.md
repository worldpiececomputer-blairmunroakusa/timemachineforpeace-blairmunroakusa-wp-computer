[1300.061521]

Good sleep, 10hr. Slow start to day, social hygeine took more time than expected, but had golden conversation that contributes well to kickstarter idea to more effectively reach target audience.

Doing chores.

Reviewing conversation chain from last two market weekends, using review to consolidate learning for purpose of creating kickstarter campaign that is consistent with long term objectives.

<p class="caption"> Conversation chain under review. Each segment is a highly significant interaction I had with someone who expressed genuine interest. Each highly significant conversation represents a token of value (personal learning) that is a product of the market booth R&D effort. Each link color was chosen by the person (people) I spoke with at the end of the conversation to add the the chain. This is a community art project, that is meant to secretly teach people how pointers work, and get people thinking about computer memory in digital non-electronic terms, using a discrete color system, where every entry represents a unit of time, with a corresponding value. 06/15/21.</p>
