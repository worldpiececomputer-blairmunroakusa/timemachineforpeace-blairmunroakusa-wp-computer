Market weekend was super fulfilling, but intense and a lot to process. I am going to have a fuckoff day by working for my buddies Cedar and Brian who own [49th State Motor Tours](https://49smt.com) as an ATV touring guide. --Make some gas cash and process time. If you are from out of town, go on a tour with them! It will rock your world.

The objective of today is to review conversations from the weekend in my head while riding a fourwheeler ~50 miles in Knik Valley. I will plan out my latest idea to solve the money problem via kickstarter, maybe will kick off this week, best case.

I am tired though.
