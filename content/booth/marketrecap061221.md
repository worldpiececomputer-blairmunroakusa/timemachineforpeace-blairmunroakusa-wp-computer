Daily market recap:

Too tired (and too busy setting up proper blog at moment) to write much. Attached picture: conversation chain of the day. Each link represents a (highly) significant conversation about peace. Community peace art.
And after reflecting on the wisdom I gleaned from all the wise people who spoke with me, a thought from me to you:
Without courage, you have nothing. I think you need to devote your life to something. This takes courage. Also, we all stand to profit from peace. I think peace is inclusive. No matter your devotion, I think you stand to profit by contextualizing it in terms of peace.
Thank you, to all the wonderful people who took time out of their day to talk about cool shit with me! You inspire me forward!

-Blair
