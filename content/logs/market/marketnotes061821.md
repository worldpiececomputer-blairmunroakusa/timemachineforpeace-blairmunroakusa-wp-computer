New bell installed. Ring for choose-your-own-adventure.

Brian / Maya, if you are reading this, you should stop by the booth for a picture with your UPC support tokens and I. It would help with the Kickstarter I am angling toward.

**Visitor interaction log (conversation chain):**

(1130) Dylan from highschool! Teal paperclip. CYOA worked pretty well...started with hi, interest in rocks...explained 1-bit rock computer, on to extracting tech value and apply to productivity systems. Wished I would have worked in the commercial aspect. Failed to leave with brainfood question prompt. Dylan 

(1150) Sam, Maryland, (intellectual blue + emotional red = purple), says I should play on mental illness aspect more...my personal motivation. I agree...people contextualize an idea, without context, an idea is meaningless...on provenance.

'What do you want to accomplish?'
'I want to change the way people think.' ...about technology, about peace, 

got into talking incentives, and had good run describing how for peace to be viable, it needs to be incentivized in a way that out performs current incentivizing forces.

Tested delivering thesis that peace is a strict prerequisite for existential problems.

(1220) Eric, copper, studio, decyphering.tv, heavy on time talk, I O, A O \inf
