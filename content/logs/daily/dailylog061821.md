Market day, hygeine, brain-boot, setup booth.

--new booth layout. I want to give visitors more space today and see if the new 'talk to me' bell works.
...also just need some space in the back to work. and optimize my booth-world piece computer process

Created a CYOA mind(arm)map to use as visual aid and stay focused. Looks crazy, but should serve as interesting filter, or at least conversation starter.

Facebook post.

_still thinking about kickstarter_ Keep it simple bro. Just use campaign to sketch big picture plan, outcomes, short game, budget.

(1050) need to annotate signage now.

Failed to annotate...got onto talking with people

(1300) Annotated intro signage.

(1400) Need to add to site:

Blair, make the sections relateable, to the interest categories that people express when they roll through the booth.

IDEA...devote subdomains to old site git images

More conversations...

Updating homepage for tmfp site

Log process crash...too tired to update after market day, sleep time.
