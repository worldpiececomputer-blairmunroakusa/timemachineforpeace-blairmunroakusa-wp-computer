[0900.061721]

Creating FAQ section, to introduce a more  conversational element to the the broadcast communication.

First adding annotation box to 00 - Kickstarter (a snippet to use for all long text piece) (adding initial feedback)

Quick break to lead now to highlight color in markdown (if possible...probably something I will need to do with inline html)
```
<span style="color:red">
```
Added color legend to 00 - Kickstarter Pretext...will reuse later

(1020) Color annotating 00 -Kickstarter pretext now would be the best way to warm up for FAQ writing.

(1120) Time to break from annotating...at about 2/3 complete...I want to move on to FAQ now.

_Quick break to remove list from homepage._
