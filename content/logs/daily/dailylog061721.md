[0900.061721]

Creating FAQ section, to introduce a more  conversational element to the the broadcast communication.

First adding annotation box to 00 - Kickstarter (a snippet to use for all long text piece) (adding initial feedback)

Quick break to lead now to highlight color in markdown (if possible...probably something I will need to do with inline html)
```
<span style="color:red">
```
Added color legend to 00 - Kickstarter Pretext...will reuse later

(1020) Color annotating 00 -Kickstarter pretext now would be the best way to warm up for FAQ writing.

(1120) Time to break from annotating...at about 2/3 complete...I want to move on to FAQ now.

_Quick break to remove list from homepage._

(1200) added new sections...populating

(1330) wrote IN

polished about

refined IN

golden conversation with dear friend about peace

run

add FAQ armmap

writing FAQ

(1900) dinner + more writing

(2100) checking to see if external links are permitted in Kickstarter campaign profile...can I rely on the website as a vehicle for providing Kickstarter campaign traffic with higher resolution? ...yeah, lots of links in kickstarter campaigns...we're good there. I will stick with the art project project type. Expose to artists first because they are typically more abstract in terms of my version of practicality, then I will let the techie types 'discover' the project by accident, word-mouth, etc. I think it will be more fun for everybody that way.

(2200) added context section, credentials, library

extras
