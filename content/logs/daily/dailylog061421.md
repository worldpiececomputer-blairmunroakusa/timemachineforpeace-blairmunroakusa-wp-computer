Long day, but solved a bunch of head problems and made enough money to afford hike/exercise gas for summer.

Finished day with non-verbal broadcast communication piece.

I am exhausted though.

Three 10hr sleeps scheduled before next market weekend. I will have ~ 32 hours (after deducting excercise/hygeine time) for kickstarter production.

Market weekend was super fulfilling, but intense and a lot to process. I am going to work one of my normal jobs today.  --Make some gas cash and process time.

The objective of today is to review conversations from the weekend in my head, with the I will plan out my latest idea to solve the money problem via kickstarter, maybe will kick off this week, best case.

I am tired though.
