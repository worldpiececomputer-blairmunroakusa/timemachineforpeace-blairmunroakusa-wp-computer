title: "_FAQ Overview"

Ok. After doing some timespace travel to review my past experience, I determined that I need to avoid some past communication mistakes. Instead of feeling like I need to linearize my headspace all at once for some invisible imaginary general audience in my head, I will instead approach content delivery as an interactive choose-your-own-adventure.

**This section will be the most important section within the timemachineforpeace subdomain space.**

The FAQ section is a collection of answers to common questions that people close to me have asked over the years, and answers to common questions that people from the Anchorage Market booth have asked over the course of the summer.

I have included email links for you to ask a question of your own. I will prioritize answering questions that are common, or important enough to address sooner than others.

Regardless of whether or not I answer, your questions serve as valuable data for moving forward with this project. Even if I do not answer a question immediately, as long as the question is appropriate, I will post it in a list for other people to ponder.

The idea is to collect questions and then answer common questions in fell-swoops. The idea is to create a collective conversation space, where I am not the only one discussing important questions about peace, and how a time machine for peace would social invention project would work.

Think of this like a choose-your-own-adventure conversational experience. Discuss amongst yourselves!

If some aspect of this FAQ or site contents pops out at you as not-quite-clear, or interesting enough to have a conversation about, come up with a simple question to guide the conversation. This helps me linearize the sprawling thing in my head. It really helps a lot.
