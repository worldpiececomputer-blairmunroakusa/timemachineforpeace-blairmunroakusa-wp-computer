<p style="font-size:8px;">COMMUNICATION STYLE DISCLAIMER: This messy kickstarter is a deliberate strategy meant to provide a transparent way of sharing my process/world. The purpose of this communication strategy is to determine the best way of going about doing things, by making my process/world completely accessible to people who may be able to help. Everything here is highly experimental. I am using this website as the writing-base for this kickstarter, so that potential backers can use github to see how the presentation has evolved over the course of the campaign, as I glom onto others willing to help refine this peace-crude.<p>

This might be hard to follow, because my mind operates in a highly nonlinear way, and at a very different frequency than mainstream anything is used to. Honestly, I rely on in-person conversation to stay focused. I rely on the linearity of other people's thought process to organize my thoughts in real time. If I just have myself in my head, I sprawl and people call me delusional and manic. It feels horrible when people call me this, so I have been working in private for many years.

This is where I will transparently work on the Kickstarter campaign to fund our efforts (right now funding to afford salary for me and the mouse in my pocket, for at least a year of dedicated work).

THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT IS GETTING THIS MASSIVE SPRAWLING IDEA OUT OF MY HEAD. MY WORLD PEACE DEPENDS ON THIS. IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS TO ME AND I WILL NOT LET ANYTHING OR ANYBODY INTERFERE WITH THIS. IF ONE ATTEMPT DOES NOT WORK, I TRY SOMETHING ELSE. I WILL KEEP TRYING UNTIL I SUCCEED OR PERMANENTLY FAIL. Please! I know this is scattered, but I need to be myself. Thank you for your patience while I figure this out as I go.

I am selling a process, not a product. This content and presentation is all very rough, because that is the idea. I do not have it figured out, but I am attempting to define a technological/social process (ai, actual intelligence, a peace process) that will hopefully allow us to figure things out as we go, individually, by one-another's sides, as a community, not a mob-mind.

For me peace is an individual process. It is not a product--not a result. We must connect our individual peace processes together in iteratively better ways. I call this **Universal Peace**.

For me the idea is to be honest about not having it figured out. To stop faking it. To just be one's self, and let the surrounding world sort things out as it may. I think we all need to adopt this approach if we are to solve our existential problems.

So for my personal situation, I adocate for strict transparency. You need to know who I am, and why. I will not censor my content, but I will aspire to be more and more graceful and tactful in my word choice and delivery. My word choice is deliberate, and if you percieve (...mike drop)

Becuase I think people are all that really matter, this idea and project is strictly incomplete without knowing the context of my inner experience and my outer experience.

I am technically a person who suffers from severe mental illness. To make sense of me in terms of those labels, think of a combination of ADHD brain, the schizophrenic spectrum (schizoaffective bipolar), and the autistic spectrum (I related strongly to self-reports of nonverbal autistics). My personality is fragmented into many bodies. Depending on how physically unhealthy I am, those personalities fall into the categories of the personality disorder clusters.

Officially, I am bipolar type 1, with persistent delusions. But my experience with the professional mental health system led me to conclude that there is actually nothing wrong with me. I am just extremely atypical and have a very difficult time fitting in, and I have a very difficult time translating my inner world into something linear that normal people understand without accusing me of being 'delusional' and 'incomprehensible' and 'sick brain'.

But here's the catch. I realized the other day (5 weeks ago when I quit my fancy-pants job to pursue this effort full time, to kick myself into the deep end) that the only reason for my suffering and inner war is that I buy into their narratives, and that at times I have been a very rude and nasty and disrespectful person in the past. This is mainly because I am frustrated and in constant emotional pain, and I thought the only way to deal with that is to numb it with dependencies, escape, or to force it onto others, so that they can share the burden. This doesn't work so well.

Now I realize that pain management is basically life management, we all hold an enormous amount of some kind of lumbering pain, and to manage life effectively a computational approach is essential.

I need help. Admitting I have a problem is the necessary first step.

Please help me get on my feet. Asking for help is the next step.

The first step is to start small and get my world right. This means I need the financial ability to be a creative independent on my own terms. I need freedom to be myself, so that I can get the big idea out of my head without risk of distortion / perversion / manipulation by disgenuine outside influence.

I have spent tens of thousands of hours working on this project at a direct capacity. This time is all toward building a concept map, or a blueprint, in my head for general communication purposes (think in terms of a mental letter-board). If I am honest with myself, besides my struggles with inner war, I have spent my entire life working on this project. Over the years have spent well over $100,000 of my own money on various attempts to develop this project, and on my education and self-grooming.

Of my many skills, I am a method actor. Of the time spend building my concept map, I have spent thousands of hours in private practicing and adjusting and evolving various deliveries of the individual concepts. All the mirror time, practicing expressions, experimenting with intonation, word-choice, versionization, attitude variation, all that. When you speak to me in person, I am referring to this concept map and all the variations I have practiced in real time, to match your needs for linearity, or nonlinearity, depending on your style.

As practice evolved into more refined process, I discovered my style. It is natural to me now. My style is genuine, yet adaptive. I can form a geniune connection with anybody.

My ability to have normal conversation and be myself depends on my mental concept map. Without my map, I am completely ineffective at communicating anything.
