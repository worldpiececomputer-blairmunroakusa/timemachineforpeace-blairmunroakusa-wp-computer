title: "07/23/21 - Project description video practice and process"
---


These are videos of me practicing and figuring out how to make a Kickstarter project description video and structure content in a way that is true to my style, etc. I absolutely hate watching myself, but it must be done. I don't have time right now to annotate all the self-criticisms and changes made since then, so I won't. I recommend saving yourself time by watching on 2x speed.

To simplify things, the card computer is no longer a reward for supporting the kickstarter. This will probably be a separate kickstarter, spearheaded by somebody other than myself.

Lot's of lies in these videos...healthy mindchanging.


#### 07/23/21

This is the latest attempt at a script to outline the whole project.

The script does not include much 'how' and 'what'.

. My treatment of the 2nd law of thermodynamics makes me cringe in horror inside. The treatment presented makes it sound like the 2nd law is defined in terms of violating energy conservation, which is strictly untrue.

INTRO ... 07/16/21

{{< youtube w-f5sk5Xl_U >}}

MINIMUM ... 07/14/21

{{< youtube BYM431Vr4vQ >}}

. My gesticulations look so contrived it makes me hurt worse inside.

. The actual intelligence bit is super confusing as to where it best fits into presentation.
 .. but is it really, that confusing? ..

HOW ... 07/16/21

{{< youtube TRaTa3VL4Gg >}}

. I meant 'worthless' or 'value-less', not 'invaluable'. Or maybe I meant invaluable, meaning that the 'pricelessness' of your brain is actually bullshit...where I think that your brain can contribute right now to society in ways that will make you money, period.

. it is up for debate as to whether or not hater / troublemaker brains are the primary problem causers, or if those brains are symptoms of the actual problem causers, which might actually be brains who don't know hate and have strictly good intentions.

. treatment of prison thinktank bit missed some key points to the idea .. basically, my point is that the people who cause problems are the experts in what led up to the problematic event. We need to include these people in the process of understanding problems and generating solutions.

. by interaction, I mean movement, or action. Actions speak larger than words, mainly because actions encode much much more information.

. I keep getting time dilation backwards in my head during this video.

. A CENTRIFUGE WOULD ONLY WORK FOR SENDING PEOPLE / MESSAGES TO THE FUTURE, AN ALTERNATIVE TO CRYOGENICS.

. No, I do not have the time to get to know you, but I desperately wish I did.

. I think I got the fractal bit all messed up...need to review Hammings bit on n-dimensional spheres...that was what inspired the fractal dimenions tangent here
