~~**BEGIN PIECE**~~

\<\< [1330.061621]

~~My frustration is that to be at peace in my world, I have a specific vision in my head I need to realize. Thus I have something I need to say to everybody.~~

~~Our planet consists of some 10 billion irreducibly unique worlds. I need to translate this vision into a message, in a way that reaches each world, so that we can coordinate a Universal Peace Process that methodically and systematically (computationally) links our worlds together in iteratively better ways. The big idea is to kick off a social invention project to invent a time machine for peace, to make better times, by synchronizing our different frequencies--or our individual energies--so that we can get a grip on solving our impossible (existential) problems.~~

~~<p style="font-size:8px;">COMMUNICATION STYLE DISCLAIMER: This messy kickstarter is a deliberate strategy meant to provide a transparent way of sharing my process/world. The purpose of this communication strategy is to determine the best way of going about doing things, by making my process/world completely accessible to people who may be able to help. Everything here is highly experimental. I am using this website as the writing-base for this kickstarter, so that potential backers can use github to see how the presentation has evolved over the course of the campaign, as I glom onto others willing to help refine this peace-crude.<p>~~

~~tHis might be hard to follow at first, because my mind operates in a highly nonlinear way, and at a very different frequency than mainstream anything is used to. Honestly, I rely on in-person conversation to stay focused. I rely on the linearity of other people's thought process to organize my thoughts in real time. If I just have myself in my head, I sprawl and people call me delusional and manic. It feels horrible when people call me this--because I don't think I am, I just have a difficult time translating my inner world to outer world--so <span style="color:purple">my personal fear and embarassment drove me to work largely in private</span> for many years.~~

~~Eventually, I developed a fragmented personality. In my head, I can have linear-enough conversations between my fragments to stay focused on my work. But all attempts to versionize my world in a linear way for an invisible audience (people unavailable for immediate feedback) does not work well. If I share my inner linearlization, you will not get it. I have to just dump the chaos and hope that people will see the intrinsic value in this different dimension I am tapped into.~~

~~If you follow closely though, the chaos will resolve. It has for me, and it has for the people who have taken the time to get to know this thing in my head.~~

~~**This is where I will transparently work on the Kickstarter campaign to fund our efforts (right now funding to afford salary for me and the mice in my pocket, for at least a year of dedicated work).**~~

~~**I will attempt to kick off the campaign this week (of today 06/16/21), and regardless of my initial acceptance at Kickstarter, I will persist by continuously adding to this Kickstarter space within timemachineforpeace.wp.computer.**~~

~~<span style="color:purple;font-size:12px">_This red text is very true, but I honestly don't need to shout now, do I??_</span>
<span style="color:red">THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT IS GETTING THIS MASSIVE SPRAWLING IDEA OUT OF MY HEAD. MY WORLD PEACE DEPENDS ON THIS. EVERYTHING IN MY WORLD DEPENDS ON THIS. IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS TO ME AND I WILL NOT LET ANYTHING OR ANYBODY INTERFERE WITH THIS. IF ONE ATTEMPT DOES NOT WORK, I TRY SOMETHING ELSE. I WILL KEEP TRYING UNTIL I SUCCEED OR PERMANENTLY FAIL.</span> _Please! <span style="color:purple;font-size:12px">_This is pleading...it doesn't suit you._</span>I know this is scattered, but I need to be myself. Thank you for your patience while I figure this out as I go._~~

~

~~<span style="color:green">I am selling a process, not a product. This content and presentation is all very rough, because that is the idea. I do not have it figured out, but I am attempting to define a technological/social process (ai, actual intelligence, a peace process) that will hopefully allow us to figure things out as we go, individually, by one-another's sides, as a community, not a mob-mind.</span>~~

~~<span style="color:green">For me peace is an individual process. It is not a product--not a result. We must connect our individual peace processes together in iteratively better ways. I call this **Universal Peace**.</span>~~

~~For me the idea is to be honest about not having it figured out. To stop faking it. To just be one's self, and let the surrounding world sort things out as it may. I think we all need to adopt this approach if we are to solve our existential problems.~~

~~<span style="color:red">So for my personal situation, I adocate for strict transparency.</span> <span style="color:purple;font-size:12px">This is strictly not true. I am still figuring out what the actual ratio is, but I have way more private thoughts than public thoughts.</span> You need to know who I am, and why. I will not censor my content, but I will aspire to be more and more graceful and tactful in my word choice and delivery. My word choice is deliberate, and if you percieve (...mike drop)~~

~~<span style="color:green">Because I think people are all that really matter</span>, this idea and project is strictly incomplete without knowing the context of <span style="color:green">**me** </span>~~my inner experience and my outer experience~~.~~

~~I am technically a person who suffers from severe mental illness. To make sense of me in terms of those labels, unofficially, think of a combination of raging ADHD brain, the schizophrenic spectrum (schizoaffective bipolar type), and the autistic spectrum (I relate strongly to self-reports of nonverbal autistics). My personality is fragmented into many bodies. Depending on how physically unhealthy I am, those personalities tend to fall into the categories of the personality disorder clusters. <span style="color:red">~~My formative experience of childhood was love, and night terror events that took weeks to shake.~~</span> <span style="color:purple">As a child, I experienced recurring night terrors and an episode of untreated major depression at an early age.</span> I am not qualified to officially claim all these things about myself, but this is the current working mental-health picture of my mind in clinical terms.~~

~~Officially, I am bipolar type 1, with persistent delusions, and ADHD PI. I also have dependency (chemical, people) issues. But my experience with the professional mental health system led me to conclude that there is actually nothing wrong with me. I am just extremely atypical and have a very difficult time fitting in being my honest self, and I have a very difficult time translating my inner world into something linear that normal people understand without accusing me of being 'delusional' and 'incomprehensible' and 'sick brain' or 'manic' or 'shadow of doom'. <span style="color:red"> \<\< Too dramatic? .. not sure this paragraph works right.</span>~~

~~But here's the catch. I realized the other day (5 weeks ago when I quit my 6-figure fancy-pants job to pursue this effort full time--kick myself into the deep end) that the only reason for my suffering and inner war is that I buy into their narratives, and that at times I have been a very rude and nasty and disrespectful person in the past. This is mainly because I am frustrated and in constant emotional pain, and I thought in the past that the only way to deal with that is to numb it with dependencies / escape, or to force it onto others, so that they can 'share the burden'. This doesn't work so well.~~

~~<span style="color:purple">Those mental health narratives and boxes are invaluable, and essential for finding the right language needed to maintain the process of healing and improving personal mental health. The only problem I had was that I would put myself in those boxes. A problem with those boxes is that they rely on a statistical app... _(aside, impending ramble, abort!)_~~

~~Now I realize that pain management is basically life management, we all hold an enormous amount of some kind of lumbering pain, and to manage life effectively a computational approach is essential.~~

~~I need help. Admitting I have a problem is a good place to start.~~

~~Please help me get on my feet <span style="color:green">in my own way, the way I believe will work best for **me**.</span> Asking for help is the next step.~~

~~But I need to be true to what I know are my needs. I know what works best for me, and that is to be myself. People actually like being around me when I am myself. So I need help in my way. This is that.~~

~~<span style="color:green">The first step to committing myself wholly to this project is to start small and get my world right. I need to break my cycle of inner war, because over the past decade it has only been escalating.</span> This means I need the financial ability to be a creative independent on my own terms. I need freedom to be myself, so that I can get the big idea out of my head without risk of distortion / perversion / manipulation by disingenuine outside influence who seek to exploit and coerce and control a free thing.~~

~

~~I have spent tens of thousands of hours working on this project at a direct capacity. This time is all toward building a concept map, or a blueprint, in my head for general communication purposes (think in terms of a mental letter-board). If I am honest with myself, besides my struggles waging inner war, I have spent my entire life working on this project for peace. Over the years have spent well over $100,000 of my own money on various attempts to develop this project, and on my education and self-grooming.~~

~~Of my many skills, I am a skilled method actor. Of the time spend building my concept map, I have spent thousands of hours in private practicing and adjusting and evolving various deliveries of the individual concepts. All the mirror time, practicing expressions, experimenting with intonation, word-choice, versionization, attitude variation, all that. When you speak to me in person, I am referring to this concept map and all the variations I have practiced in real time, to match your needs for linearity, or nonlinearity, depending on your style.~~

~~As practice evolved into more refined process, I discovered my style. It is natural to me now. My style is genuine, yet adaptive. I can form a geniune connection with anybody. This is an aspect of myself that people have a hard time believing. I get it.~~

~~<span style="color:green">(These days, since I have internalized this style, one of my favorite activities is **freestyle** communication and experimentation, live. I enjoy most when the freestyle takes on a certain lyricism...words and intonations have a way of sounding rhythmic and melodic together when they find the best fit.)</span>~~

~~My ability to have normal conversation and be myself depends on my mental concept map...<span style="color:green">in my head I treat is like a</span> <span style="color:blue">blueprint</span>. Without my map, <span style="color:red">I am completely ineffective at communicating anything.</span> <span style="color:purple;font-size:12px">_Actually, not quite true, I can still communicate, but only on the verymost superficial and empty terms. For deep stuff, without my concept map, I get frustrated and go catatonic/get angry._</span> My entire world revolves around this map, which is contextualized in terms of solving the **universal peace problem**. If we do not solve the world peace problem, all other problem solving efforts are doomed to fail. This is not my contrarian perspective, but I certainly bet my life on this statement.~~

~

~~I will attempt, using this Kickstarter campaign, to dump my mental concept map outlining my vision over the course of this summer, while I use my Anchorage Market 'Time Machine For Peace!' booth as an outlet for practicing my presentation in-person to arbitrary interested strangers. I will rely on others to resolve this concept map in real time. I understand exactly what I am getting myself into, and <span style="color:purple">if I am completely honest</span>, I am terrified. But <span style="color:purple">I am no longer</span> afraid of success. This needs to happen, and <span style="color:red">as long as people are killing each other and themselves, there is no time for taking things slow. Not for me at least.</span> <span style="color:purple;font-size:12px">...I can still be <span style="color:green">**chill**</span> about it though...because people will always be killing each other and themselves...at least at the current evolutionary state of our species...</span> ~~

~~<span style="color:red">~~In two weeks, I will officially be living out of my truck.</span> <span style="color:purple;font-size:12px">This is true, but I honestly love camping...it will be a camping summer for me, which is cool.</span>~~ (not true anymore.) I invested all my money into my business to pursue this all-in full-send bet, and can't afford much other than food and gas/insurance and data. If this attempt at reaching my tarket market / audience fails, <span style="color:red">I will cut ties from Alaska</span> <span style="color:purple;font-size:12px">...Alaska is my home and always will be...I will just on a wandering adventure...it probably won't come to this though...and I think you should have a strategic plan for **every** contingency... </span> and wander the country with my cardboard signage until I can find the right people to help, until I can find the right audience.~~

~~My dad told me once that I am sick and completely incapable of supporting myself. He is wrong about me being sick, but <span style="color:red">he is right about me being incapable of supporting myself</span>.  <span style="color:purple;font-size:12px">Too personal, and I understand my father's concern...I have been very unwell in the past. He probably also believes that I am capable of supporting myself, because I know I am. I know I can support myself in the typical way, but I have not yet proven I can support myself in the atypical way I would prefer. This will come.</span>~~

~~<span style="color:green">I need your support.</span>~~

~~<span style="color:red">Unless somebody else on this planet is pursuing this vision outlined by my concept map like I am, I believe that We need your support, too.</span><span style="color:purple;font-size:12px"> Too messianic complex...I know people with a vision like mine exist...the purpose of broadcasting is in large part to find these people so that we can integrate our vision versions into something more whole.</span> This is not about me, but right now, I have to start with me<span style="color:purple;font-size:12px"> ...in my world, it starts with me... </span>.~~

~~I wish highly optimized peace-process upon your many worlds.~~

~~-Blair~~
