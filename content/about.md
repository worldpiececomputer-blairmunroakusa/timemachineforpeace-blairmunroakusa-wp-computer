Peace is a process, not a result.

This is a site to chronicle and coordinate the Time Machine For Peace social invention project.

First, some symbols to make communication easier:

<p class="caption">Symbol for 'world piece (or peace, if referring to the ideal) (time machine (or trademark))</p>

For now, this site is a blog chronicling my process and experience running the Alaska, Anchorage Market 'Time Machine For Peace!' booth. This will be the primary communication vehicle for getting the point across, and getting this project off the ground, up and running.

The booth is basically a Research and Development lab. I quit my dayjob and spent almost all of my personal savings to set the overall outreach project up (not recommended at all for trying at home, unless you put your time in preparing for the possible crash-and-burn). The investment is meant to put me in a position where I can share the monsterous idea in my head with all sorts of different people, to attain valuable wisdom and feedback I need to make the best-informed decisions possible for how to steer this project into the future. **You will be the navigational experts guiding this time machine.** I am just the captain.

So come travel timespace with me! Let's travel to better future, to make better a present, by working together to do awesome stuff that nobody has ever done! (But if you want to roll solo, do so. I of all people respect the solo lifestyle. If you want to roll solo, but still be a part of steering, just get in touch. Share your perspective. It is valuable, be it positive, neutral, or negative.)

My [personal page](https://blairmunroakusa.wp.computer/) is a good place for going deep with experimental theory and conceptual underpinnings. Otherwise, this site is a good place to call homebase if you are interested in the idea of universal peace, a process for linking our multitude of unique worlds together, so that we can all reap more profit that we otherwise would without peace as a universal process. (Creation and inclusion will always be more profitable than destruction and exclusion. I believe this.)

I plan to use this blog as an origin, a central point to originate promotional activities for this project. Next stop, Kickstarter. I need to solve the money problem quicklike.
