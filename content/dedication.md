It's a long list, but I could easily make it much much longer.

<font size="1">
I dedicate the Time Machine For Peace social invention project to the following people:

 - Victims of war in all forms, both external and internal
 - American veterans who took the oath to support and defend the values of the US Constitution ...especially those who paid the ultimate price ...especially those who embrace a fierce hatred for war. Without you, I would not have the immense priviledge up upbringing in domestic peace that allowed me to grow into what I am.
 - Law enforcement
 - People struggling with mental illness
 - Atypical people struggling to be themselves in a judgemental xenophobic world
 - People struggling to find their voice, because they have something they desperately need to say
 - Free thinkers who face oppression
 - The interested--yet impartial--observers
 - The overwatch
 - My family
 - All the people who have shared their wisdom and experience with me, either directly or indirectly, living or dead

... if you have had a genuine or disingenuine conversation with me, no matter how short, you have contributed to this project
