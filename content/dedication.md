I dedicate the Time Machine For Peace social invention project to the following people:

 - Victims of war in all forms, both external and internal
 - American veterans who took the oath to support and defend the values of the US Constitution _(not the system)_ ...especially those who paid the ultimate price ...especially those who embrace a fierce hatred for war
 - People struggling with mental illness
 - Atypical people struggling to be themselves in a judgemental xenophobic world
 - People struggling to find their voice, because they have something they desperately need to say
 - Free thinkers who face oppression
 - The interested--yet impartial--observers
 - The overwatch
