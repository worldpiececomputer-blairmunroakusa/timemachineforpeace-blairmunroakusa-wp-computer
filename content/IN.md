##### THE TIME MACHINE FOR PEACE DESIGN PLAN IN A SINGLE EXPRESSION:

<div class="figure" style="figure-size:small;">

![](/images/UPCtmPLAN.jpg)

<p class="caption" style="font-size:10px">UPC tm (The Universal Peace Computer, timemachine) is continually-integrating sum (Intsum) of all individual WPC tm (world piece computers, timemachines) each of which are IntSums of all WP tm (world pieces, time machines) in a given WPC operator's world</p>


</div>

There are some 10 billion Human worlds in our Human Universe. Each world is irreducibly unique. Each world contains a multitude of world pieces. Each world piece is a world of it's own.

##### **Question:**

> How do we fit all the Human worlds plus all their world pieces together in a way that maximizes the good, and minimizes the bad?

Call this the _Human Optimization Problem_.

##### **Answer:**

> We recognize that there is no perfect fit, and the best-fit solution is continually changing, because our individual worlds are continually evolving.

Call the act of committing to an adaptive evolutionary actual intelligence **(ai)** algorithm to address this problem _The Human Imperative_.

##### **A Universal Contrarian Perspective:**

It is possible to align every Human contrarian perspective by inventing more sophisticated actual intelligence algorithms that are contextualized in terms of Universal Peace.

Define **Universal Peace** as the continually evolving process of improving our **ai** by connecting our multitude of Human worlds together in iteratively better and more productive ways. Universal Peace is **inclusive and creative**.

##### **A Universal Peace Thesis:**

No matter who you are, you stand to profit more via a process of **inclusion and creation** than you would profit otherwise via a process of **exclusion and destruction**.

OR

Our global economy will be healthier if we contextualize our affairs as Humans in terms of Universal Peace.

##### **A Universal Peace Hypothesis**

People who contextualize their lives in terms of Universal Peace will be more effective and lead more fulfilling lives than people who do not.

OR

Human systems that are contextualized in terms of Universal Peace will work better and be less oppressive than equivalent systems that do not.

##### **competition**

We should test this hypothesis with friendly competition.

_<font size=2>...and so that poor cat was let out of that damned box...</font>_

##### **LET THE GREAT PEACE(SPACE) RACE BEGIN**

The peacespace race is inclusive. We are not racing against each other. We are racing against the clock--the scarce resource of Human time|energy is always running short.

I believe the societal benefits we stand to reap by inventing a time machine for peace to solve the Human time|energy shortage are inconceivable.

I propose we invent a time machine for peace; let's make better times.

##### _HOW CAN I CONTEXTUALIZE MY WORLD IN TERMS OF UNIVERSAL PEACE?_
### _HOW WOULD I PROFIT FROM UNIVERSAL PEACE?_
